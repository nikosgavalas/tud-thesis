% There are several types of disk-based key-value stores available, including:

% LevelDB: A popular open-source key-value store that is optimized for read-heavy workloads and has a small memory footprint.

% RocksDB: A fork of LevelDB that is designed to handle a wider range of workloads, including write-heavy ones.

% LMDB: A high-performance, memory-mapped key-value store that supports multi-threading and transactions.

% Cassandra: A distributed key-value store that is optimized for write-heavy workloads and provides tunable consistency levels.

% Riak: A distributed key-value store that is designed for high availability and fault-tolerance and supports both eventual and strong consistency.

% Berkeley DB: A mature and battle-tested embedded key-value store that supports transactions, replication, and high availability.

% Kyoto Cabinet: An efficient and lightweight key-value store that is designed for high-speed data storage and retrieval.

% Redis: A popular in-memory key-value store that also provides disk-based persistence, making it suitable for large datasets that cannot fit in memory.
