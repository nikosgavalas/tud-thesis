\section{Summary}

In this work, we have implemented three different key-value stores, as state backends that support incremental snapshotting in transactional dataflow SFaaS systems.
We analyzed their behavior and the trade-offs governing their operation under different settings of their parameters, gaining insight on how they should be tweaked to deliver the best performance according to the use case.
Then, we performed fair comparisons between them, indicating the strengths and weaknesses of each and the domains on which each of them excels.
Finally, we implemented logic to support incremental snapshotting capabilities and rollback to previous versions, and evaluated this as well.
