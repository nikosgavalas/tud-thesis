\section{Log-Structured Merge-Tree}

% LSMT with size-tiered compaction (write-optimized)

% explain how it works

% possible optimizations:
% 1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6SI8VbcT4w
% 2. fence pointers can be used to organize data into compressible blocks
% 3. the .filter and .pointers files could be embedded to the runfile (and then do a relative seek from the end)
% this would help with the save to replica things


\section{Append Log}



\section{Hybrid Log}

% possible extensions/optimizations applicable to all engines:
% concurrency! explain how it can be applied, what to lock etc.
% mmap for the files
% checksums for malformed records
